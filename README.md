[ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá](README.zh-TW.md) | English

A web application demonstrating Snap's Camera Kit integration with video recording capabilities. This project allows users to apply Snap Lenses and record videos with the effects.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY WARNING**  
> **DO NOT USE THIS REPOSITORY FOR CLIENT PROJECTS**  
> The Camera Kit API Token is exposed in client-side code in development.
> For production deployment:
>
> - Use Vercel's environment variables (see [Deployment on Vercel](#deployment-on-vercel-) section)
> - Never commit real credentials to GitHub
> - Keep sensitive tokens in your local `config.js` for development only

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites üìã

- Node.js (v14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Camera Kit credentials from Snap

> üí° **New to Node.js?**
>
> 1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
> 2. After installation, open your terminal/command prompt
> 3. Verify installation by typing:
>    ```bash
>    node --version
>    npm --version
>    ```
>    Both commands should show version numbers

### Installation üíø

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gowaaa/camerakit-web-w-recordfeature.git
cd camerakit-web-w-recordfeature
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

> üí° **Note**: For first-time installation, `npm ci` is recommended as it:
>
> - Ensures exact versions from package-lock.json
> - Is faster and more reliable
> - Provides consistent installations across all environments
>
> Only use `npm install` if you need to modify dependencies (add new ones or update existing ones).

3. Configure Camera Kit credentials:
   Create `src/config.js` with your credentials:

```javascript
export const CONFIG = {
  LENS_ID: "__LENS_ID__",
  GROUP_ID: "__GROUP_ID__",
  API_TOKEN: "__API_TOKEN__",
}
```

### Development üîß

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Webpack will start a development server with HTTPS enabled.
You'll see two URLs in the terminal:

- Local: `https://localhost:9000`
- Network: `https://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:9000` (for mobile devices)

To test on your mobile device, use the Network URL shown in your terminal.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes**:

- Your mobile device must be on the same WiFi network as your computer
- Accept the self-signed certificate warning in your browser when testing
- HTTPS is required for camera access on mobile devices

### Production Build üèóÔ∏è

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Output will be in a new `build` directory.

### Deployment on Vercel üöÄ

> üí° **New to Vercel?**  
> Vercel is a platform that makes it easy to deploy websites. You'll need:
>
> 1. A GitHub account - [Sign up here](https://github.com/signup)
> 2. Your project code pushed to GitHub
> 3. A Vercel account (you can sign up with your GitHub account)

To deploy securely on Vercel without exposing your Camera Kit credentials:

1. Create a Vercel account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Choose "Continue with GitHub"
   - Follow the authorization steps

2. Import your GitHub repository:

   - Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Select your repository
   - Click "Import"

3. Add your Camera Kit credentials as environment variables:

   - In your project dashboard, go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
   - Add these three variables exactly as shown:
     ```
     LENS_ID=your_actual_lens_id_here
     GROUP_ID=your_actual_group_id_here
     API_TOKEN=your_actual_api_token_here
     ```

4. Create a new file called `vercel.json` in your project root:

   ```json
   {
     "buildCommand": "npm run build",
     "outputDirectory": "build",
     "rewrites": [
       {
         "source": "/config.js",
         "destination": "/api/config"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. Create a new file `api/config.js`:

   ```javascript
   export const config = {
     runtime: "edge",
   }

   export default function handler(request) {
     const config = `export const CONFIG = {
       LENS_ID: "${process.env.LENS_ID}",
       GROUP_ID: "${process.env.GROUP_ID}",
       API_TOKEN: "${process.env.API_TOKEN}"
     }`

     return new Response(config, {
       headers: {
         "Content-Type": "application/javascript",
       },
     })
   }
   ```

This setup will:

- Keep your credentials secure in Vercel's environment
- Generate the config.js file dynamically
- Never expose credentials in your repository

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**:

- Using environment variables on Vercel keeps your credentials secure
- Never commit actual credentials to your repository
- Use `config.js.example` for local development (copy to `config.js` and add your credentials)
- The API route will securely provide credentials in production

## Browser Support üåê

- Chrome (latest) ‚úÖ
- Firefox (latest) ü¶ä
- Safari (iOS 14.5+) üì±
- Edge (latest) üåç

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Build Errors**:

   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check webpack configuration
   - Verify file paths in imports

2. **Camera Issues**:

   - Use HTTPS for camera access
   - Grant camera permissions
   - Check browser compatibility

3. **Recording Issues**:
   - Ensure sufficient device storage
   - Check MediaRecorder support
   - Verify permissions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About Dependencies

This project requires specific dependency versions to function correctly. Please:

- Do not modify `package-lock.json`
- Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` because:
  - It's faster and more reliable
  - It ensures exact versions from package-lock.json
  - It removes node_modules before installing
  - It won't update package.json or package-lock.json

The Camera Kit integration is sensitive to dependency versions. Modifying these may break the functionality.

Happy coding! üé•‚ú®
